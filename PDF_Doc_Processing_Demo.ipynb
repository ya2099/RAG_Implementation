The Human Factors Design Standard  (HF-STD-001B) is \\na comprehensive reference tool that will help human factors professionals \\nwithin the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and contractor \\norganizations to efficiently carry out FAA human factors policy. \\nApplication of this design standard is not a substitute for in-depth professional \\nhuman factors practice.  The FAA Acquisition Management System refers to \\nHuman factors as a critical aspect of aviation safety and effectiveness.  \\nPlanning, analysis, development, implementation, and in-service activities \\nmust include human factors engineering in order to achieve desired levels of \\nsafety and effectiveness.  Human factors engineering should be integrated with \\nthe systems engineering and development effort throughout the acquisition \\nprocess.  This document can serve as a critical tool for aiding this process by \\nproviding input to acquisition and development documentation, processes, \\nand activities.  However, in order to be effective, human factors acquisition \\nstandards and processes should be professionally applied.  The use of this \\nstandard requires expert professional judgment on its application to systems \\nand equipment. \\nPurpose \\nThe purpose of this standard is to provide a single easy-to-use source of \\nhuman factors design criteria oriented to the needs of the FAA mission and \\nsystems.  An additional goal is to facilitate use of appropriate design criteria \\nby organizing the document so that users can easily locate the needed \\ninformation. \\nThe objectives developed to create this document reflect the working \\nphilosophy used to form this standard into a useful human factors reference \\ntool. \\nSome of the objectives in creating this document were to: \\na. place relevant human factors information in a single document rather \\nthan multiple diverse human factors documents; \\nb. provide highly relevant information based on research or accepted \\npractices for use by FAA and contractor human factors professionals in \\nsystem acquisitions or modifications and in the evaluation and \\nselection of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental \\nItems (NDI) procurements; \\nc. provide human factors information in the form of clear, concise, \\nusable standards;  \\nd. organize the document so that users could easily locate the needed \\ninformation; \\n \\n \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

It consolidates human factors knowledge, practice, and prior experience \\ninto requirements for application to new systems and equipment.  It was \\nconceived as a “living document” to be revised as new information became \\navailable.  Aside from revisions to individual chapters, this document \\nrepresents the first major revision of HF-STD-001 since its release in 2003. \\nThis document compiles extensive guidance from diverse sources for human \\nfactors applications integral to the procurement, acquisition, design, \\ndevelopment, and testing of FAA systems, facilities, and equipment.  It will aid in \\nidentifying functional, product, and NAS specification requirements and in \\nensuring acceptable human factors practice and products. \\nThis standard is applicable to COTS and NDI procurements as well as new \\ndevelopmental system or equipment acquisitions.  The relationship between \\nhardware and software subsystems and the human subsystem's \\ncharacteristics must be determined and tested in advance of commitments to \\nprocure and implement COTS and NDI equipment and systems.  These \\ncharacteristics can include human roles, organizations, interfaces, tasks, \\ntraining, and human performance effectiveness. \\nThis standard draws heavily from human factors information published by \\nother government organizations, including the Department of Defense, \\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Department of Energy.  \\nThe FAA recognizes the excellent quality of information found in many of the \\ntechnical documents and handbooks written by these agencies. \\nReason for Change \\nA primary reason for changing the 2003 HF-STD-001 is to make the document \\ncomply with FAA-STD-068 “Preparation of Standards.”  FAA-STD-001A has \\nbeen organized into sections instead of chapters based on the requirements \\nof FAA-STD-068 (2007), and all of the requirements have been renumbered.  \\nA crosswalk is included at the end of the document that identifies the \\ncorrespondence between the old and new requirement numbers. The \\npresent document also revises the previously published material by changing \\nrequirements to only allow one should or shall statement per requirement. \\nThis change was made in response to requests from acquisition program offices \\nwithin the FAA. \\n\", metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

DESIGNING EQUIPMENT FOR MAINTENANCE \\nThis section contains human factors rules intended to make equipment \\nmaintenance easy, fast, and safe.  Equipment maintenance does not, of \\ncourse, occur in isolation.  The overall system of which the equipment is a part \\naffects the design of the equipment; for example, if the system must run \\ncontinuously, the equipment might be designed to allow maintenance while it \\nis in operation, or some sort of redundancy might be provided.  The system \\nmaintenance concept also affects equipment design; for example, is a \\nparticular unit of equipment intended to be repaired on site?  Is it intended to \\nbe removed and repaired at another location?  Or is it intended to be \\ndiscarded and replaced with another unit?  A third factor affecting equipment \\ndesign is the physical environment in which it will be located; will it be \\nexposed to weather or to temperature extremes?  Will the user be wearing \\ngloves or other protective clothing?  Finally, equipment must accommodate \\ncharacteristics of the users themselves, their sizes and shapes, their skills, and \\ntheir training. \\n5.2.1.   GENERAL \\nThis section contains rules for:  (a) designing equipment in general, (b) \\nemphasizing maintenance during the design of equipment, modules, and \\ncomponents, (c) maximizing the use of existing equipment and tools, (d) \\nminimizing the skill and training requirements for users, and (e) minimizing the \\nneed for maintenance.  \\n5.2.1.1.   GENERAL DESIGN GUIDANCE \\nOne of the most important aspects of designing equipment for maintenance is \\nthe breaking up of a unit of equipment into modules that are independent, \\ninterchangeable, and easily replaced.  If warranted, these modules can also be \\ndisposable.  Other important aspects are: ease of access to test and service \\npoints, ease of access to internal parts and components, and, if warranted, \\nbuilt-in testing, diagnostic and fault localization capability. \\nDefinitions.  A unit of equipment is an assemblage of items that \\nmay include modules, components, and parts that are packaged \\ntogether into a single hardware package.  For example, a computer, \\nits keyboard, and its visual display are all units of equipment, as are \\nradio transmitters and receivers.  A module is an assemblage of two or \\nmore interconnected parts or components that comprise a single, \\nphysical and functional entity.  It is this singular functionality that \\ndefines a module.  A component is a subdivision of a unit of \\nequipment that can be treated as an object by the user, but which \\ncan be further broken down into parts.  A mounting board together \\nwith its mounted parts is an example of a component.  A part is an \\nobject that cannot normally be broken down further without \\ndestroying its designated use.  Fuses, resistors, and capacitors are \\nexamples of parts. \\n \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 62, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

UNITIZATION OF EQUIPMENT \\nUnitization is the packaging of equipment in physically and functionally distinct \\nunits that can be easily removed and replaced.  This sort of separation can \\nhave a number of advantages, such as providing easy access to malfunctioning \\nequipment, allowing a high degree of standardization, simplifying and \\nspeeding equipment design by using previously developed standardized \\ndesigns, and reducing the skill and training requirements for users. \\nDefinitions.  A unit of equipment is an assemblage of items that \\nmay include modules, components, and parts that are packaged \\ntogether into a single hardware package.  For example, a computer, \\nits keyboard, and its visual display are all units of equipment, as are \\nradio transmitters and receivers.  A module is an assemblage of two or \\nmore interconnected parts or components that comprise a single, \\nphysical and functional entity.  It is this singular functionality that \\ndefines a module.  A component is a subdivision of a unit of \\nequipment that can be treated as an object by the user, but which \\ncan be further broken down into parts.  A mounting board together \\nwith its mounted parts is an example of a component.  A part is an \\nobject that cannot normally be broken down further without \\ndestroying its designated use.  Fuses, resistors, and capacitors are \\nexamples of parts.  The packaging of a unit of equipment is the \\nassembling, mounting, and enclosing of the items it includes. \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.2.3.1.1  Functional design.

CASES, COVERS, GUARDS, AND SHIELDS  \\nThis section contains rules governing the size, mounts, shape, location, \\nfasteners, interlocks, and labels of cases, covers, guards, and shields. \\nDefinitions.  A case is the part of a unit of equipment that encloses \\nand protects the equipment from its surroundings.  It may also \\nserve to protect the surroundings - including users - from the \\nequipment.  A cover is a part of a unit of equipment that closes an \\naccess opening.  A guard is an enclosure or barrier intended to \\nprevent inadvertent or unauthorized operation of a control.  A shield \\nis an enclosure or barrier intended to protect components that are \\nsusceptible to damage or to protect maintainers from possible injury.   \\nCovers, guards, and shields may take a variety of forms, including (a) hinged \\ndoors or caps, (b) sliding doors or caps, (c) removable doors or caps, (d) \\nremovable panels, and (e) physical barriers. \\nHinged doors and caps allow the fastest and easiest access; they require few \\nfasteners and, depending upon their orientation, may not need support in the \\nopen position.  They do require \"swinging\" space, and they may intrude on the \\nuser\\'s workspace. \\nSliding doors or caps are particularly useful where \"swinging\" space is limited.  \\nThey do not generally provide a tight seal.   \\nRemovable doors or caps require little space for opening and, once removed, \\ndo not interfere with working space.  Handling them does take time and effort. \\nRemovable panels can give access to large portions of a unit of equipment.  \\nThey do not require \"swinging\" space, but they may be awkward to handle or \\nsusceptible to damage. \\n5.2.5.1.

All of these \\ncan affect the ease or difficulty of maintenance activities. \\nDefinitions.  A module is an assemblage of two or more interconnected \\nparts or components that comprise a single physical and functional \\nentity (for example, a printed circuit board).  It is this singular functionality \\nthat defines a module.  A component is a subdivision of a unit of \\nequipment that can be treated as an object by the maintainer, but \\nwhich can be further broken down into parts.  A mounting board \\ntogether with its mounted parts is an example of a component.  A part \\nis an object that cannot normally be broken down further without \\ndestroying its designated use.  Fuses, resistors, and capacitors are \\nexamples of parts.  Packaging is the grouping of functions, components, \\nand parts into units or modules; layout is the physical arrangement of \\nthe parts and components that make up a module or a unit of \\nequipment; mounting is the positioning and attachment of parts, \\ncomponents, and modules. \\n5.2.9.1.

A transilluminated display is a display in which light \\npasses through the element being viewed.  These displays include \\npanels and indicators that use back- or edge-lighting and that use \\nclear, translucent, fluorescent, or sandwich material.  There are \\nthree general types of transilluminated displays that are widely \\nused: (1) legend lights that present information in the form of \\nmeaningful words, numbers, symbols, and abbreviations, (2) simple \\nindicator lights, and (3) panel assemblies that present qualitative \\nstatus or system readiness information.

A user should be \\nable to select a range of characters in a text display using the SHIFT key in \\nconjunction with navigation keys.  [Source: Microsoft Corp., 1992]  \\nDefinition/discussion.  Several keys, such as Home, End, Page Up, \\nPage Down, and the arrow keys, are dedicated to keyboard \\nnavigation and thereby are called the navigation keys.  By holding \\ndown the SHIFT key while pressing any navigation key (for example, \\nHome, End, Page Up, Page Down, or an arrow key), the cursor \\nmoves to the location implied by the navigation key, and all \\ncharacters between the anchor point and the destination are \\nselected.

Selection by clicking – To select by clicking, the user positions the \\npointer over the desired item and clicks the mouse button.  A click refers \\nto pressing and releasing a particular button on the mouse input device.  \\nDepending on the software and platform being used, selection may \\nrequire a single or a double click. \\nb. Selection by dragging – To select by dragging, the user drags the cursor \\nover a range of items while holding down the mouse button. \\nc. Changing a selection with command-click - To make discontinuous \\nselection in a text or array application, the user selects the first item in \\nthe usual manner and holds down the command key while selecting the \\nremaining items.  \\nDiscussion.  Each item is selected in the same manner as if it were \\nthe whole selection, but because the command key is held down, \\nthe new items are added to the existing selection instead of \\nreplacing it.  If one of the pieces selected with command-click is \\nalready within an existing part of the selection, the item is removed \\nfrom the selection.  [Source: Apple Computer Inc., 1995] \\n5.6.12.

ON-LINE HELP \\nOn-line Help can provide procedural aids, the ability to recover from errors, \\nand advice without requiring a user to exit from the application.  Ideally, on-\\nline Help is always available and sensitive to the context within which it is \\nrequested.   \\nDefinition.  On-line Help is primarily an interactive, context-sensitive \\nsource of information that can tell a user what entry to make at the \\ncurrent location in an application, what keystrokes are required, or \\nwhat steps are required to complete a task.  Secondarily, on-line \\nHelp is a form of on-line documentation and reference information.   \\nAn on-line Help facility may provide any or all of three types of \\nHelp:  advice, active Help, and passive Help.   \\nAdvice is an interactive, context-sensitive source of information that \\nindicates what entry to make at the current location in the \\napplication, the required keystroke(s), or which steps to take to \\ncomplete the task.   \\nActive Help senses an inappropriate entry and interrupts the task to \\nask users what they are attempting and if they are sure they want \\nto complete the operation they have just initiated.  Depending upon \\nthe user response to the question, active Help then suggests the \\ncorrect action.   \\nPassive Help simply responds to user requests for information.  The \\ninformation may be in the form of on-line system documentation, \\nsuch as a user's guide or a list of functions performed by \\ncombinations of key presses.

WORKSTATION AND WORKPLACE DESIGN \\nThis chapter deals with the design criteria associated with workstations and \\nworkplaces.  A workstation is a place designed for a specific task or activity \\nfrom where work is conducted or operations are directed.  Desks, offices, \\nrepair benches, tools, equipment, and computer terminals are examples of \\nthese special accommodations and equipment.  Workstations are designed as \\nareas for one or more workers to use in accomplishing purposeful tasks or \\njobs.  A workplace is defined as an area room or establishment where work is \\ndone.  The chapter is organized so as to start from the design of a single \\nworkstation then broaden to multiple workstations and workplaces. \\nThe following design criteria affect systems, equipment, and facility design.  \\nCompliance will help enhance the performance of FAA personnel.  Some of the \\nrules address the interaction of maintenance and operational activities. \\n5.8.1.   GENERAL \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.8.1.1  Design for human activities.  Workplace and associated equipment \\ndesigns shall systematically incorporate the effects of tasks, performance \\ncapabilities, physical dimensions, and viewing dimensions for maintainers and \\nfor operators.

The physical dimensions of workplaces and \\nequipment shall conform to the anthropometric and biomechanical \\ncharacteristics of the specific population of users for whom the system is being \\ndesigned and to the characteristics of the tasks to be performed.  \\nAnthropometric and biomechanical data are found in Chapter 5.12.  [Source: \\nNASA-STD-3000A, 1989] \\nExamples.  Those areas that deal with clearance dimensions that a \\nlarge portion of the user population could be expected to use \\nfrequently or in a life threatening situation require as a minimum \\nthe 99th percentile value for clearance.  Heavy traffic passageways \\nand normal doorway clearances are examples.  Similarly, the 1st \\npercentile values for reach and strength are used as limiting \\ndimensions.  These values ensure that the smallest personnel can \\nreach and open escape mechanisms.  In most other cases, the \\nconvention of designing for the 5th through 95 percentile is used \\nfor practical design related reasons.  Male and female personnel are \\nincluded in the anthropometric data.  The higher percentile values \\nare often dominated by male data and the lower values by female \\ndata (see Chapter 5.12 and its references for treatments of \\nanthropometric practice). \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.8.1.3  Work space to permit access.

STANDING WORKSTATIONS  \\nStanding workstations are used for routine, frequent, or short term jobs or \\ntasks for which the worker needs to be able to face different directions or to \\nmove from one position to another.  The designer can exploit the following \\nadvantages of a standing position when they are compatible with the tasks to \\nbe performed: \\na. When standing, workers can apply more muscular arm force and make \\nlarger arm movements than when seated.  These forces may be applied \\nto levers or valves. \\nb. Standing workers can move to see and use components in areas that \\nwould be inaccessible to seated users. \\nc. Standing workers can move about to reduce fatigue and boredom. \\nd. Standing workers can use flat working surfaces without knee room, thus \\nsaving space. \\ne. A standing workstation is not as dimensionally constrained as that of the \\nseated operator.  Equipment that standing operators view or adjust may \\nbe placed anywhere around them as long as it is at the proper height. \\nDiscussion.  If the worker is not free to move about, or if the task \\nand attention demands are concentrated so that the worker \\nremains in one position, the workstation should be designed so the \\nworker can sit or take a sit-stand position.  The main disadvantage \\nof the standing position is that the worker's physical workload is \\nincreased because one constantly has to carry one's own weight \\nand stabilize and balance one's body. \\n\\uf0fa \\n5.8.2.6.1  Standing workstation and workbench dimensions.

This order \\ncancelled FAA Order 1600.54B, Automated Information Systems Security \\nHandbook.  FAA Order 1600.54B is cited frequently throughout this chapter.  \\nThe information in this chapter will be revised at a future time to reflect the \\ncancellation of FAA Order 1600.54B. \\n \\nThis chapter pertains to the human factors aspects of security safeguard \\nfeatures for new (or modified) facilities, systems, and equipment that are to \\nbe acquired and maintained by the FAA.  Human factors considerations can \\nenhance the security effectiveness and suitability of new or upgraded systems. \\nDefinition.  Security safeguards are the protective measures and \\ncontrols that are prescribed to meet the security requirements \\nspecified for a system.  Those safeguards may include but are not \\nnecessarily limited to: operational procedures, physical security, or \\nhardware and software features. \\nThe FAA Order 1600.54, FAA Automated Information Systems Security \\nHandbook, and associated directives explain security safeguards associated \\nwith communication security, necessary provisions for classified information, \\nand security safeguards such as Tempest requirements.  \\nDiscussion.  From a system analysis viewpoint, \"security \\nsafeguards\" need to be thought of as a subsystem of any new \\noperational system.  The human component of any operational \\nsystem or subsystem, as well as the security component need to be \\nconsidered and technically integrated from the concept phase \\nthroughout the procurement and implementation phase. \\nThe FAA modernization program increasingly relies on automated processing \\nsystems.  New computer technologies make it possible for remote users to \\naccess large databases through communication networks.  \\nTelecommunications systems and Automated Information Systems (AIS) \\nboundaries are becoming vague and are highly susceptible to interception, \\nunauthorized access, exploitation, and hostile threats. \\n5.9.1.

PHYSICAL SECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROL \\nPhysical security addresses the application of physical barriers and control \\nprocedures as preventive measures or countermeasures against threats to \\nresources (for example, automated assets, facilities, telephone lines, or \\ninformation).  Good physical access control takes into account threats to a \\nprotected area due to vandalism, theft, modification, or destruction.  This \\nsection gives rules for regulating the physical access to FAA systems, the \\nfacilities that house those systems, and other FAA assets. \\nThe physical security provided to a facility is based upon the protection \\nmeasures derived from security risk and requirements analyses.  Provisions for \\nprotection are to be built into systems, subsystems, facilities, and equipment \\nwork areas in accordance with the selected protection features and the \\nsecurity policies applicable to the NAS environment. \\nPhysical security and access control requirements can be found in FAA Orders \\n1600.54B and 1600.6C. \\n\\uf0fa \\n5.9.2.1  Automatic access control.

A lockout uses a mechanical mean \\nto disable a control or switch in its safe position (for example, \\nelectricity disconnected) and to prevent its activation without the \\nuse of undue force or tools.

AVOIDING PITFALLS IN APPLYING ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA \\nThere are several common errors to be avoided by designers when they \\napply anthropometric data to design.  These are: (1) designing to the \\nmidpoint (50th percentile) or average, (2) the misperception of the typical \\nsized person, (3) generalizing across human characteristics, and (4) summing \\nof measurement values for like percentile points across adjacent body parts. \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.12.1.3.1  Misuse of the 50th percentile or of the average.  The 50th \\npercentile or mean shall not be used as design criteria as it accommodates \\nonly half of the users.  [Source:NASA-STD-3000A, 1989] \\nDiscussion.  When the population distribution is Gaussian \\n(normal), the use of either the 50th percentile or the average for a \\nclearance would, at best, accommodate half the population. \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.12.1.3.2  Misperception of the typically sized person.  A percentile value \\nand its measurement value that pertains to a particular body part shall be \\nused exclusively for functions that relate to that body part.  [Source: \\nDepartment of the Air Force (AFSC DH 1-3), 1980; NASA-STD-3000A, 1989] \\nDiscussion.  The same percentiles values are not necessarily the \\nsame across all dimensions.  A person at the 95 percentile in \\nheight is unlikely to measure at the 95th percentile in reach or \\nother dimensions. When the middle 30 percent of a population of \\n4000 men was measured on 10 dimensions, only one-fourth of \\nthem were \"average\" in a single dimension (height), and less than \\n1 percent were average in five dimensions (height, chest \\ncircumference, arm length, crotch height, and torso \\ncircumference).  Keeping in mind that there is not an \"average \\nperson,\" one also must realize that there is not a \"5th percentile \\nperson\" nor a \"95th percentile\" person.  Different body part \\ndimensions are not necessarily highly correlated.  An implication is \\nthat one cannot choose a person who is 95 percentile in stature as \\na test subject for meeting 95 percentile requirements in reach or \\nother dimensions. \\n\\uf0a7 \\n5.12.1.3.3  Summation of segment dimensions.

The 95th percentile arm length, for instance, is not \\nthe addition of the 95th percentile shoulder-to-elbow length plus \\nthe 95th percentile elbow-to-hand length.  The actual 95th \\npercentile arm length will be somewhat less than the erroneous \\nsummation.  To determine the 95th percentile arm length, one \\nmust use a distribution of arm length rather than component part \\ndistributions. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 530, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

USER DOCUMENTATION \\nThis section provides criteria and rules for the development of documents \\nthat will be used by operators and maintainers in the performance of routine \\nand corrective use of systems and equipment.  User documentation includes \\nuser guides and manuals, user handbooks and technical instructions, job \\nperformance aids, quick reference guides, and instruction placards. \\nTo be successful, a document must be appropriate to the knowledge and \\nskills of its users, to the tasks they will perform using the document, and to \\nthe environment in which the users will perform these tasks.  To ensure \\nsuccess, document development usually includes the following steps: (a) \\ndetermine the relevant characteristics of the users of the document, in \\nparticular, their existing knowledge and skills, (b) determine the \\nenvironment in which the document will be used, (c) determine the tasks to \\nbe covered by the document, (d) determine the users' information \\nrequirements, (e) determine the appropriate types of documentation, (f) \\ncreate draft documents, (g) perform technical review(s), (h) perform usability \\ntests, and (i) prepare documentation for release. \\nUser documentation is part of the interface between the users and other \\nsystem components.  It contributes to the user's cognitive understanding of \\nthe hardware, software, and human interactions with these other \\ncomponents of the system.  It can serve as a job aid and as a supplement to \\n(but not a substitute for) system training.  Thus, this section contributes to \\nthe usability and effectiveness of the operational system and is to be applied \\nto new systems and equipment acquisitions and modifications as a part of \\ndevelopment and procurement.  \\nThe first part of this section is devoted to criteria and rules for the \\ndevelopment of printed user documentation in general.  These general \\ntopics include organizing the document, writing the text, and laying out the \\npage.  These topics are followed by criteria and rules for the individual \\ncomponents that comprise a user document, such as the title page, figures, \\ninstructions, and indexes. \\n5.13.1.   GENERAL \\nThe users of a document want the document to help them perform their \\ntasks quickly and efficiently.  However, these users differ from each other in \\nmany ways in level of expertise, in motivation, in time constraints, in work \\nstyles, in reading abilities, in attitudes, in personal preferences, in age, and \\nso on.  The more these differences are accommodated, the more effective a \\ndocument will be to its individual users.  This section recommends some \\nways to match documentation to users and ways to make the \\ndocumentation appear easy to use. \\n\", metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 577, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Novice users might \\nbe given detailed, step-by step instructions to complete a \\nprocedure, while expert users might simply be given the name of \\nthe procedure to be completed -- a sort of checklist. \\nAnother approach is to code information for different skill levels.  \\nFont size and type, opposite or alternative pages or paragraphs, \\nshaded or color-coded boxes or borders, and position location on \\na page can be used to indicate applicable skill levels.

ORGANIZATION \\nGood documentation has a clear conceptual organization.  The organization \\nneeds to be compatible with its purpose and understandable to its users.  \\nThe organization helps the users find relevant information in order to carry \\nout their functions and tasks.  There are three major ways to help the user \\nunderstand the conceptual organization: (a) the use of titles and headings, \\n(b) the visual appearance of the document, and (c) a hierarchical numbering \\nsystem. \\nDiscussion.  The features of the document can be reviewed for \\ninput by a user group early in its development.  These users can \\ncontribute to its conceptual organization. \\nThis section includes rules on the use of a variety of techniques that can help \\nusers use a document more effectively. \\n5.13.2.1.1.   TITLES AND HEADINGS \\nTitles and headings are of major importance to users; they help users find \\nrelevant information, understand the organization of the document, and \\nmaintain awareness of their location in the document.  \\nDefinitions.  A title is a word or phrase that describes or identifies \\nthe contents of a document or a portion of a document.  A \\nheading is the title of an organizational subdivision of a \\ndocument, that is, a title that has hierarchical significance.   \\nDiscussion.  Headings are usually set apart from the text to which \\nthey refer in a way that indicates the hierarchical structure of the \\ndocument.  This may be accomplished with the use of horizontal \\nand vertical spacing.  In addition, headings are usually \\ndifferentiated from text typographically, for example, by the use \\nof larger type size or increased boldness, or both.   \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 579, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

The \\nprimary considerations are whether or not users will want the document to \\nlie flat when opened (see paragraph 5.13.3.1.2.2) and whether or not \\nindividual pages of the document will be removed and new pages inserted \\n(see paragraph 5.13.3.1.2.3). \\nDefinitions.  In mechanical binding, the pages are punched with \\neither round or slotted holes and then placed in a ring binder or \\nbound with a comb or spiral binder.  In perfect binding, the pages \\nare assembled, the left side is cut and roughed, glue is applied, \\nand the cover is attached to the pages.  In pamphlet binding, the \\npages are stitched or stapled together.  There are two types of \\npamphlet binding, saddle stitched and side stitched.  Saddle \\nstitching permits the document to lie flat. \\n\\uf0fa \\n5.13.3.1.2.1  Page orientation.

PAGE-LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS \\nIt is desirable that the visual structure of a document, that is, its cues and \\nformat, is reflected and complemented by the structure in the table of \\ncontents.  The primary objective of the text designer is to create a visual \\nhierarchy that distinguishes major concepts from sub-concepts and one \\ncategory of information from another.  Ways to do this include varying the \\nsize of type and the position of the material on the page.  Visual cues are \\nmost effective when used sparingly. \\n\", metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 592, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

WHITE SPACE \\nThe spatial formatting of text can be extremely effective in communicating \\nthe structural hierarchy of information.  The consistent and logical allocation \\nof vertical and horizontal white space creates a visual hierarchy that \\nseparates major headings from minor headings, headings from text, and so \\nforth.  The judicious use of spacing can convey information about the \\nstructure of a document to users more easily and effectively than can \\ntypographic cues.  White space can be used in combination with \\ntypographical cues.  Reduced line lengths and associated horizontal white \\nspace can make skimming, searching, and reading easier.

[Source: Gribbons, 1992] \\nExample.  A logical point to start in determining vertical spacing is \\nthe smallest vertical unit, the space between two lines of text.  If \\nthis space is taken to be one unit of spacing, the resulting \\nrepresentational spacing might be two units between paragraphs, \\nfour units between a subheading and a paragraph, and eight units \\nbetween a major heading and a subheading.

[Source: \\nGribbons, 1992] \\nDiscussion.  Horizontal spacing is not as straightforward as vertical \\nin indicating hierarchical levels.

COMPONENTS OF DOCUMENTS \\nThis section contains rules for the various components that might be \\ncontained in a user document, such as the cover page, table of contents, and \\nfigures.  Exhibit 5.13.4 lists FAA directives associated with certain types of \\ndocuments that are oriented to FAA users and lists the components and the \\nsequence for components, when applicable for each type.  These directives \\nand related specifications listed in Exhibit 5.13.4 also call for mandatory \\nitems: forms to identify and control changes and some explicitly required \\nparagraphs and text.  These mandatory policies are to be followed for each \\napplicable type of document. \\nDiscussion.  FAA Order 1320.1D addresses directives in general \\nand includes long orders (more than 25 pages) which may be \\ncalled handbooks.  The order describes the orders development \\nprocess and prescribes some formal formatting details for \\norganizational-level orders or supplements.  FAA Order 1320.58 \\naddresses Maintenance Technical Handbooks and equipment \\nmodification directives.  These are exempted from 1320.1D \\nformatting provisions. \\nThere are two kinds of user-oriented documents that apply to the \\nimplementation of specific modification programs: modification \\nmanuals and modification instructions.  The manuals are to have \\nsimilar components to those listed in the exhibit under Maintenance \\nTechnical Handbooks.  When either of these modification program \\ndocuments are manufacturer's documents, they may be treated \\nas technical issuances as is explained later.  FAA-D-2494/b, 1984 \\naddresses instruction books for operation and maintenance of \\nnew or modified systems and equipment.  With FAA permission, \\ninstruction books may also be technical issuances.  In such cases, \\nwriters and publishers may use other formats and organizations.  \\nFAA-D-2494/b includes an appendix that addresses a general \\nevaluation of commercial instruction books. \\nDefinition.  Technical Issuances, according to FAA Order 1320.1D, \\nare publications acquired from non-agency sources or developed \\nwithin FAA that directly concern installation, maintenance, or \\nmodification of equipment, equipment systems, facilities, or \\naircraft.  Manufacturers' instruction books for plants and \\nequipment are included in this category.  A basic objective of \\nusing this category is to permit the merging of internally-\\ndeveloped and externally-acquired technical manuals and \\npublications into consolidated, single source documents.  Because \\nof necessary deviations from standard directive format and \\nissuance procedures, they are designated technical issuances. \\nThe detailed guidance of this user-interface guide represents \\nadvisable practice to help design-in and facilitate human \\nperformance as a component of new or changed operational \\nsystems.  Its provisions may be selectively applied to user-\\ndocumentation of new and modified systems.  It may be used to \\nhelp evaluate user documentation on NDI and COTS procurements. \\n\", metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 602, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

INTENDED USE \\nNo single human factors professional or designer can be expected to be \\nknowledgeable in all aspects of human factors.  By collecting information based \\non research and best practices, this document makes available the collective \\nknowledge of many human factors professionals. \\nContrary to the idea that human factors standards apply only to developmental \\nacquisition programs, COTS items can also benefit from the application of \\nhuman factors standards.  COTS items, software, in particular, have a great deal \\nof variability in quality of interface design.  The information within this \\ndocument can be useful to compare the quality of design for different COTS \\nitems, facilitating informed acquisition decisions. \\nThe application of the standards in this document cannot guarantee good \\ndesign for a variety of reasons. Although this document focuses on achieving \\ngood design and consistency within and between systems, the standards within \\nthis document can be implemented in different ways.  Standards cannot \\nreplace good human factors expertise.  A designer who is very knowledgeable \\nin human factors might do well without using any standards whereas a novice \\ndesigner might do poorly even with the help of standards. \\nThe result of using this document in development and acquisitions will be a \\nmore usable system.  However, even systems that are carefully designed using \\nthis document in conjunction with a human factors expert will need to be \\nverified through means such as prototyping and testing with representative \\nusers.  Testing will allow the designer to confirm the positive design features \\nand identify any negative design features that may have been missed by the \\nstandards and the human factors professional. \\nAlthough these standards are necessarily general in order to apply to the wide \\nrange of systems and equipment within the FAA, they can be made into system \\nspecific rules.  Not all of the standards proposed here may be applicable to \\nevery system.  For any particular system, some of the standards will be relevant \\nand some will not.  Additionally, the use of this document cannot substitute for \\nknowledge of task (user and system) requirements.

TAILORING GUIDANCE \\nTo ensure proper application of this standard, a knowledgeable human factors \\nexpert should tailor the requirements in this standard to meet the needs of a \\nspecific program and exclude any unnecessary requirements.  This section \\ndescribes a process that can be utilized for detailed tailoring of this standard. \\nTailoring is not just selecting and excluding certain requirements from a \\nstandard, but involves several additional processes to make the requirements \\nfit the application and the program. Tailoring includes determining if any \\n“shoulds” should be elevated to “shalls” or “shalls” reduced to “shoulds,” \\nassessment of the verifiability of selected requirements, deriving requirements, \\nidentifying redundant requirements, and assessment of the likelihood for initial \\nrequirements to become not applicable as the design implementations are \\nselected. While the various aspects are addressed in the general chronological \\norder in which they occur, some can occur simultaneously and iteratively. \\n6.2.1.   DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF DETAIL FOR TAILORING \\nThe human factors practitioner’s first step is to estimate the level of detail at \\nwhich he or she can address all the human factors requirements, given the \\nbudget, schedule, and nature of the program. \\nMany sections go to the 1.2.3.4.5 level. The most detailed tailoring actually \\ngoes beyond inclusion or exclusion of the lowest numbered paragraphs, by \\nincluding or excluding one or more components under a single “shall” number. \\nFor example, many requirements take the format, “1.2.3.4.5 The widget shall \\nmeet the requirements a, b, and c.” If “a” and “b” are applicable but “c” is not, \\nthe number level requirement should be included with a note tailoring out part \\n“c.” Note that at each level, the identification of questionable requirements is \\nalso part of the depth tailoring. This category should be used to mark \\npotentially applicable requirements for further evaluation. For example, the \\nhuman factors practitioner may be aware that there are security standards \\nimposed, but may not be familiar with their detailed requirements. A question \\nmark and note tags the requirement as potentially applicable, but that \\nadditional information is required to determine if it should be imposed (e.g., is \\nit redundant or inconsistent with the program’s security requirements?). \\nTailoring the requirements at the most detailed level provides the greatest \\ntechnical and managerial benefit. The benefits of detailed human factors \\nrequirements tailoring are: \\n1. Fewer surprises. \\n2. Human factors requirements can be defined at a specific and \\nunambiguous level.  \\na. Subsequent documents will require minimal additional \\ntailoring. \\nb. Allows earlier assessment and more frequent input from \\ntechnical disciplines affected by the human factors \\nrequirements. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 634, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

The scope of the human factors program can be accurately \\nassessed by the FAA and by contractors. \\na. Allows FAA management and human factors personnel \\nto more accurately estimate costs, prepare the human \\nfactors section of the statement of work (SOW), and \\naccurately evaluate bidder’s human factors cost and \\ntechnical proposals. \\nb. Allows more accurate estimation of human factors \\nprogram costs and appropriate technical response to the \\nhuman factors section of the SOW. \\nc. \\nAllows more accurate, complete, and mature Human \\nFactors Program Plan. \\n4. Requirements issues, such as applicability, conflicts, costs, \\nredundancies, gaps, ambiguity, and verifiability can be \\nidentified early and efficiently. \\na. The earlier detailed requirements are identified, the \\nsooner they will be addressed by those affected. \\nb. The earlier the requirements are resolved, the less risk \\nthere will be in each subsequent stage of design and \\ndevelopment. \\nTypically, the earlier detailed tailoring occurs, the better. The earlier human \\nfactors requirements are defined, the more problems will be avoided later \\nwhen corrections cost more. Even the identification of some requirements or \\nrequirements areas as questionable contributes to risk identification and more \\nefficient mitigation. However, there will be times when the budget and \\nschedule do not allow human factors practitioners to perform detailed \\ntailoring, despite the compelling arguments that it will cost a lot more to do so \\nlater. The worst-case response is for human factors tailoring to be done by \\nsomeone unskilled in human factors, which risks the production of an \\ninaccurate and incomplete tailoring. It is better to have an accurate high-level \\ntailoring than an inaccurate and incomplete detailed tailoring. The former \\nimposes all the necessary requirements and some unnecessary requirements, \\nbut the unnecessary requirements are relatively easy to eliminate later when \\nresources are available. Conversely, the inaccurate and incomplete detailed \\ntailoring implies that the human factors requirements have been identified at a \\ndetailed and comprehensive level, and a specific subset imposed at the \\nexclusion of all others. It will be inefficient, confusing, expensive and \\ncontentious to delete inappropriate requirements and introduce new (missing) \\nrequirements later. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 635, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Managers are \\ncognizant of programs that have doubled or tripled in cost, and have even been \\nterminated due to requirements creep. For this reason, managers may be more \\naccepting of what appear to be a few simple high-level requirements, than a \\nlengthy list of detailed requirements. As a result, tailoring is often limited to \\nimposing a human factors standard in its entirety or at the chapter level. \\nHowever, imposing a standard in its entirety or even by chapter actually \\nimposes more requirements than imposing a subset of those requirements \\nproduced by a detailed tailoring. The perception is that imposing single chapter \\ncontains fewer requirements than a multi-page listing of dozens of tailored \\nrequirements extracted from the chapter. Of course, since the tailored \\nrequirements are a subset of the entire chapter, imposing the entire chapter \\nmust contain more requirements by definition. This fact is not necessarily \\nimmediately apparent during a requirements review. \\nMore detailed tailoring is almost always more beneficial than less detailed \\ntailoring. Earlier detail is almost always more beneficial than later detail. High-\\nlevel but accurate tailoring is usually better than inaccurate and incomplete \\ndetailed tailoring. Since it is usually beneficial to perform detailed tailoring as \\nearly as possible, the only constraints to more detailed tailoring are the \\nconstraints on the human factors practitioner’s schedule and budget. The \\nperception of too many human factors requirements should be considered and \\nmanaged. \\n6.2.2.   IDENTIFYING THE APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS \\nRequirements identification is accomplished by evaluating each requirement in \\nthe context of the types of users and the ways they will interface with the \\nsystem. A top-down approach is most efficient, as one can rule entire sections \\nin or out by determining, for example, if there will or could be automation, if \\nthere will be graphical user interfaces, and if there is any control over the \\nworkplace or environment. The human factors practitioner must be familiar \\nenough with the acquisition to make these determinations. The same process is \\napplied at the subsection level on down, pruning the surviving sections, \\nsubsections, and paragraphs to the greatest extent allowed by knowledge of \\nthe system, availability of human factors resources, and program constraints on \\ntime and effort at each stage of the acquisition. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 636, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

A “should” represents \\nrecommendations and best practices information that is applicable in most \\ncases but may involve trade-offs or be influenced by context-specific factors. \\nThe human factors practitioner is free to impose “shalls” and “shoulds” \\naccording to needs of the application, program, users, and stakeholders. \\n“Shalls” may be changed to “shoulds” if: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement is too expensive to meet. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement is too vague to design or verify. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement is too expensive to verify. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would be desirable if the requirement were met, but not \\nmandatory. \\n“Shoulds” may be changed to “shalls” if: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement is mandatory and not just desirable (users will \\nreject the design if the requirement is not met). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement provides value added at virtually no cost. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe requirement provides so much value added, it is worth the \\nadditional cost. \\nTailoring “shalls” and “shoulds” applies not only to each numbered provision as \\na whole, but within any numbered provision that imposes multiple provisions. \\nConsider a provision that states, “The widget shall meet requirements a, b, and \\nc.”  “a” and “b” may be good provisions for the application, but “c” may be \\nreduced to a “should” due to any of the reasons cited above. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 637, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

VERIFICATION OF THE SELECTED REQUIREMENTS \\nRequirements that are difficult or impossible to verify are problematic. \\nAssessing the verifiability of the tailored requirements is necessary to \\ncharacterize the verification issues and scope the volume of problematic \\nrequirements, which in turn is prerequisite to formulating a verification \\napproach or policy. The process is straightforward but tedious, as it requires \\ncareful review of each detailed requirement. \\nThere are two primary dimensions of verifiability - objectiveness and cost. The \\nfirst step is to determine if each tailored requirement is subjective or objective. \\nThe next step is to determine if verification is expensive or inexpensive. The last \\nstep is to determine if requirements that are expensive to verify are worth the \\ncost, and if not, if they should be eliminated or retained as “should” \\nrequirements. \\n6.2.5.   OBJECTIVENESS \\nIf the measurement of a requirement always produces the same result, \\nregardless of who takes the measurement (contractor or FAA), then the \\nrequirement is objective. Examples include weight, contrast ratio, dimensions, \\netc. Subjective requirements use terminology that may be interpreted \\ndifferently by different people, resulting in different measurement techniques, \\ncriteria, and results.  \\nThe tailoring effort should at least identify the number of subjective \\nrequirements so the human factors practitioner has some idea how much of a \\nverification issue exists. At some point, however, a determination must be \\nmade on what to do with each subjective requirement. This determination can \\ntake the form of additional tailoring of individual requirements (e.g., derivation, \\nelimination) or it could be based on a broad policy statement identifying the \\nformal group or entity that will judge compliance on subjective requirements. \\nThe possible dispositions of subjective requirements are: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nEliminate them; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nImpose them as “shoulds” with no verification required; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nVerify them subjectively without an agreement between the FAA \\nand contractor; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRequire the contractor to propose verification methods for them, \\nsubject to FAA \\n\\uf0b7 \\napproval; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nVerify them subjectively by a decision authority imposed by the FAA \\nor agreed upon by the contractor and the FAA; or \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDerive objective requirements. \\n \\n \\n \\n', metadata={'source': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'file_path': 'Doug_Demo/Design_Standards_Test.pdf', 'page': 638, 'total_pages': 753, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Vicki Ahlstrom', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2010', 'creationDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20161230111508-05'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",
